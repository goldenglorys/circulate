- Multiple Load Balancing Algorithms:
    - Round Robin
    - Random
    - Least Connections
- Real-time updates of request distribution.
- Dynamic IP Addition - Add new IP addresses dynamically.
- Visual Feedback - Get visual feedback on which IP handled the most recent request.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React with React Flow for visualization
Backend: Flask (Python)
